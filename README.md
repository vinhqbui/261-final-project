# Flight Delay Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting flight delays using a robust machine learning pipeline implemented with PySpark. The goal is to provide accurate predictions by optimizing model performance and aligning evaluation metrics with business objectives.

## Key Features
- **ML Pipeline**: Built and deployed a flight delay prediction model using PySpark.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Used Hyperopt for systematic tuning to achieve optimal model performance.
- **Performance Metrics**: Achieved an F-beta score of 0.9, balancing precision and recall effectively.

## Files
- `Flight-Prediction Phase 3 - (Final Report).ipynb`: The final report on the model and its performance.
- `Phase 3 - HyperOpt.ipynb`: The notebook demonstrating hyperparameter tuning with Hyperopt.
- `Phase 3 - Modeling - best.ipynb`: The notebook containing the best-performing model.
- `Team 6-2 Presentation (Final).pdf`: Final presentation slides summarizing project outcomes.
